<p>Hi, I'm Melanie, a Ruby Dev, blogger, and runner from Seattle, WA.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 2014, my husband and I packed up our lives, rented out our house in Seattle, and kicked off a year of traveling the world. Over the past year, I've discovered my passion for writing, nourished my love of learning, and have become a productivity ninja.</p>

<p>Currently, we're based in the beautiful town of Sevilla, Spain, where we spend our days working from the sunny apartment we found on Airbnb. I enjoy fiddling with exercism.io, working with various APIs, and working on a handful of Rails side projects.</p>

<p>My travel blog, (aptly) named <a href="http://www.wevemadeahugemistake.com">We've Made a Huge Mistake</a>, chronicles our journey around the world. Fair warning: I've occasionally been known to use sarcasm.</p>

<p>Want to get in touch with me? Fill out the form below to send me a message and I'll get back to you in a jiffy!</p>
